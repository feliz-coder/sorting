# Sorting

## Getting Started

1. fork this repository on GithubHub.
1. clone your forked repository to your local projects directory.
1. cd into this repository.
1. ensure you have yarn, then `yarn install` to install dependencies.

### InsertionSort
1. run `yarn test`
1. the specs will initially fail.
1. look at the specs, `specs/insertion_sort_spec.js`. You will notice that it is importing code from `lib/insertion_sort.js`. Go to `lib/insertion_sort.js` file, and you will see an incomplete `InsertionSort` class that needs completing. Modify that code using the insertion sort algorithim so that the spec passes.
